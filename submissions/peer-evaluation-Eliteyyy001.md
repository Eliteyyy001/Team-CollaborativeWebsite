**Comments:**  
Teammates have been present and hands on with the project. They actively find good ways to resolve project confusions and ultimately arrive at a solution
that is beneficial for the project. Hannah handles time very effectively and makes notes of every document and process required to complete tasks. 
Hamza seems to have a slight challenge in understanding the process but we will work as a team to get him up to speed.
